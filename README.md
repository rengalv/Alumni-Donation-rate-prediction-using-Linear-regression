# Alumni-Donation-rate-prediction-using-Linear-regression
The project aims at identifying the factors influencing the alumni giving rate at universities and developing a linear regression model for predicting the alumni giving rate based on the factors considered. The data used for the project is the alumni.xls file which has data for 48 national universities (Americaâ€™s Best Colleges, Year 2000 Edition). The analysis was performed using the variables in the dataset along with their interactions. As an outcome of the analysis, we find that we can use only the Student/Faculty ratio variable as the predictor to make relatively precise and accurate predictions for the alumni giving rate.
